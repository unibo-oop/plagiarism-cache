 * methods, some are reserved for {@link it.unibo.jmpcoon.model.entities.Entity}s exclusive use only. This factory is
 * intended for enforcing such rules. Because multiple games can be created, multiple {@link World}s can be created,
 * but this should be done from different {@link it.unibo.jmpcoon.controller.game.GameController}s. For meeting those
 * two different needs, for each factory, only one {@link World} can be created, but at the same time multiple factories
 * can be created. It will be {@link it.unibo.jmpcoon.controller.game.GameController} responsibility to create no more
 * than one {@link WorldFactory} for each game.
