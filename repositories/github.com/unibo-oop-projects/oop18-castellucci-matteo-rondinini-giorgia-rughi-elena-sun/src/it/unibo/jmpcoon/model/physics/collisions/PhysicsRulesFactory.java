 * Interface for a factory of listeners which model the rules of physics of this game. The necessity of a factory is due
 * to the fact that a listener shouldn't be created twice, otherwise if used correctly the collisions will be resolved
 * twice. This interface could not rule out the fact that this factory itself could be created twice and because of this
 * create the rules twice, but this couldn't be done because the rules needs to be created once per game and not once
 * per application execution. That being said, it's left as a warning to never instantiate twice this factory, also
 * because it's a factory and should produce more elements if needed without another instantiation, differently from a
