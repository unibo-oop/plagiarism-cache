 * An immutable Data Transfer Object (DTO) representing a player's score breakdown.

 * 
 * @param playerName          the display name of the player
 * @param cardsOnTable        points gained from cards melded on the table
 * @param cleanBurracoPoints  total bonus points from clean Burraco sets
 * @param dirtyBurracoPoints  total bonus points from dirty Burraco sets
 * @param closureBonus        points awarded for ending the round (closure)
 * @param potPenalty          penalties incurred for not taking the side pot
 * @param cardsInHandPenalty  negative points from cards remaining in hand
 * @param roundTotal          the final sum of points for the current round
 * @param matchTotal          the cumulative score including previous rounds
 * @param isWinner            true if the player has won the entire match
 * @param finalHand           a read-only list of cards remaining in the hand at closure.
 *                            To guarantee immutability, this should be defensive-copied
 *                            (e.g., via List.copyOf) before initialization.
