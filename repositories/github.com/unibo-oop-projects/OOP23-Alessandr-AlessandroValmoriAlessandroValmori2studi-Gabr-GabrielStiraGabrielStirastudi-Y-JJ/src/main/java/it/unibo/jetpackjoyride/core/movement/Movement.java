/**
 * The {@link Movement} is one of the two elements which characterize every
 * entity along with the {@link Hitbox}.
 * This class encapsulates elements such as position, speed, acceleration and
 * rotation which allow entities to be represented in a two dimensional space.
 * A record is used as a simple data-carrying class to store the most important
 * values which characterize the movement ({@link MovCharacterizing});
 * A list of modifiers is also used to define common behaviours for the classes
 * which use {@link Movement}. The list of modifiers is associated to a list of
 * {@link MovementModifier}, a class used to create and add every kind of personalized 
 * modifier to a movement.
 * This class also provides a method to get a relative position which is the
 * position of the entity scaled based on the current screen size.
 * This is an immutable class, hence the creation of a new {@link Movement} class is
 * required every time the movement has to be updated. 
 * While it could seem more resource consuming compared to a mutable
 * implementation, there are several reason a mutable one can be preferred.

     * constructors (one with three parameters, three with two parameters, three
     * with a single parameter), which are way too many and confusing to use

     * - the Movement class has more parameters of the same type, and it is
     * unclear to understand, in a call to its contructor, which is which. By using
     * the builder, we emulate the so-called "named arguments".

     * better than accessing directly the values or using lots of getters and

     * which "may expose internal representation by storing an externally mutable...".
     * The movement class was actually mutable before, but all these problems led to
     * think that an immutable, side-effects free implementation was better, even 
     * if more resource-consuming (since a new class has to be created every time
     * an entity updates its movement, which actually happens a lot, but the number
     * of entities which do this at all times is generally really low).
