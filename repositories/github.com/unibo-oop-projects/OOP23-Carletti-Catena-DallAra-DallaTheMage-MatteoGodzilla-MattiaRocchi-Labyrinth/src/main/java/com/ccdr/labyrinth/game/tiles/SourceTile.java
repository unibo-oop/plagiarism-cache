/**
 * How source tiles work in the game:
 * - A source tile starts with a set amount of materials as soon as it's created
 * - A source tile can only give one type of material to the player.
 * - A source tile can be either inactive or active, only active ones reward the
 * player.
 * - Once a player steps on the tile, it will be rewarded an amount of materials
 * and the source tile will become inactive.
 * - After N turns (where N is the number of players), the source tile will
 * become active with the minimum quantity.
 * - If a tile is active, every turn it will increase the amount of materials
 * stored inside, until the maximum quantity.
