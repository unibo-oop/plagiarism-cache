/**
 * Defines a basic interface for a controller that manages and centralizes model
 * and view events or state changes.
 * <p>
 * The {@code Controller} interface is responsible for handling events and
 * changes in state from both the model
 * and view components of the application. It acts as the central point of
 * control, ensuring that all updates and
 * state changes are processed consistently. The controller is designed to be
 * independent of both view and model
 * implementations, making it suitable for integration into the main application
 * logic.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface typically serves as the entry point for starting and stopping
 * the controller's operations, and it
 * manages the lifecycle of associated threads or processes.
