/**
 * Represents the state of a player in the game.
 * This interface defines the behavior of a player based on their current status
 * It follows the State design pattern.
 * The player's state can be one of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>In Jail:</strong> The player is currently in jail and has
 * specific rules governing their actions, such as attempting to roll doubles to
 * get out or reaching the maximum number of turns in jail.</li>
 * <li><strong>Free:</strong> The player is not in jail and can move freely
 * around the board, manage their properties, and interact with other
 * players.</li>
 * <li><strong>Bankrupt:</strong> The player has lost all their money and is out
 * of the game. They cannot take any actions and are effectively removed from
 * play.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The {@link PlayerState} interface defines the methods that govern the
 * player's actions during their turn, ensuring that the correct behavior is
 * executed based on their current state.
