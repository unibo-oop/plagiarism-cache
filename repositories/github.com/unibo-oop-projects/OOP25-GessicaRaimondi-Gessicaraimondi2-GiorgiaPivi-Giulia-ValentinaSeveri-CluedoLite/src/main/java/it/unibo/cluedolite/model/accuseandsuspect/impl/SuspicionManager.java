 *  - validates that the player is currently in a room before allowing a suspicion
 *  - creates and returns a {@link Suspicion} object with the given character, weapon, and room
 *
 * <p>This class belongs to the MODEL layer and contains no view or controller logic.
 * The room is received directly as a parameter from the controller,
