 * This class represents an Audio Store, providing functionality for managing and retrieving audio clips.

 * Throughout the game, the Audio Store keeps track of audio clips and makes sure they are easily accessible.
 * Additionally, it has the ability to handle errors and terminate the program if necessary.
